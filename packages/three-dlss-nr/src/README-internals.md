# three-dlss-nr internals: writing and testing a kernel

three-dlss-nr ports [OpenDLSS-NR](https://github.com/maanHimself/OpenDLSS-NR) by maan (MIT, pinned at `9d08f41`) to
three.js TSL. The spec for every kernel is the reference WebGPU port (`reference/OpenDLSS-NR/ports/browser-webgpu`),
byte for byte; the design (`three-dlss-nr-design.md`, Appendix A) lists the byte-level rules per kernel. This page
covers the foundation the kernels are built on.

`reference/refKernels.ts` (single reference dispatches), `reference/refNetwork.ts` (the whole reference network),
`setup/fetchShim.ts` (`file:` and `synthetic:` fetch; `registerSyntheticFiles`). Reference modules are imported as
`@ref/<file>.js` (vitest alias; typed `any` by `test/ref-shims.d.ts`).

## Writing a kernel

```ts
import { If, localId, workgroupId } from 'three/tsl';
import { grid1d } from '../geometry.js';
import type { NRKernel, NRTensor } from '../types.js';
import { kernel } from '../tsl/KernelBuilder.js';
import { nrEncodeE4m3, nrF16Bits, nrRoundF16 } from '../tsl/numerics.js';
import { f, loadHalf, packWord4, u } from '../tsl/packed.js';

export function createHalveToE4(input: NRTensor, output: NRTensor, label: string): NRKernel {
  const count = input.rows * input.channels; // a multiple of 4
  return kernel({
    label, // the reference's dispatch label, e.g. 'block 5 expert expand'
    kind: 'halve', // the reference's entry point; also the compute node's name
    workgroupSize: [64],
    dispatch: grid1d(count / 4), // explicit [x, y, z] workgroup counts, never a count
    inputs: { source: input }, // bound read-only; WGSL name nr_source
    outputs: { target: output }, // bound read_write; recorded in `writes`
    body: ({ source, target }) => {
      const quad = workgroupId.x
        .add(workgroupId.y.mul(u(65535)))
        .mul(u(64))
        .add(localId.x)
        .toVar();
      If(quad.lessThan(u(count / 4)), () => {
        const code = (k: number) =>
          nrEncodeE4m3(nrF16Bits(nrRoundF16(loadHalf(source, quad.mul(u(4)).add(u(k))).mul(f(0.5)))));
        target.element(quad).assign(packWord4(code(0), code(1), code(2), code(3)));
      });
    },
  });
}
```

- All buffers are `array<u32>` views; a byte tensor is written a whole word (4 values) per invocation and a half
  tensor a whole word (2 values). There is no 8- or 16-bit store: thread mappings must own whole words.
- Shapes, strides, flags are JS numbers baked into the node graph (the reference's `override`s). Kernels that differ
  only in buffers produce identical WGSL and share one compiled program; keep labels out of the generated code.
- A kernel's body runs lazily, when three first builds the node; buffers must be declared in `inputs` / `outputs`.
- Run a frame with `runKernels(renderer, kernels)` (one compute pass, in order, validation error scope) or
  `renderer.compute(kernels.map((k) => k.node))`. Read with `readBuffer(renderer, tensor)`.
- Look at the generated code with `kernelWGSL(renderer, kernel)`; snapshot `normalizeWGSL(...)` to catch drift.

## Comparing against the reference

```ts
const gpu = await createGpuTestContext(); // our device, shader-f16 when available
const ref = await RefKernels.create(gpu.device); // the reference port on the same device
const reason = ref.unavailableReason('gemm_fp8'); // e.g. 'needs shader-f16, which this device lacks'
if (reason) return context.skip(reason); // use it.for(...)(name, async (args, context) => ...)

const input = ref.tensor('in', rows, k, 'e4', bytes);
const out = ref.tensor('out', rows, n, 'e4');
ref.fill(out, SENTINEL_BYTE);
ref.gemm({ input, weights: ref.fp8Matrix({ bytes: w, k, n, scales }), output: out, rows, k, n, label });
await ref.run();
const expected = await ref.read(out); // validBytes, like the reference's readback

const ours = createTensor('out', rows, n, 'e4');
fillSentinel(ours); // R6: an unwritten output stays 0xCD on both sides
await runKernels(gpu.renderer, [createGemmFp8(spec, { input: oursIn, weights, output: ours })]);
const verdict = compareCodes(await readBuffer(gpu.renderer, ours), expected);
expect(verdict.verdict).toBe('bit-exact');
```

`RefKernels` also records `gemmF16`, `op` (ops.wgsl entry points), `windowAttention` and `vit` dispatches, and exposes
the recorder for anything else. Where the reference cannot run (see below), compare against the CPU oracles
(`test/oracle/gemm.ts`, `numerics/oracle.ts`); `test/reference/refKernels.gpu.test.ts` ties those oracles to the
reference on every device where the reference runs.

### Where the reference runs

The reference's FP8 GEMM, window attention and SiLU-table builders need `shader-f16`. Whether Dawn in Node exposes it
depends on the backend: **not on the Windows dev machine** (RTX 3060 Ti: D3D12 lacks DXC in the `webgpu` package's
Dawn build, and NVIDIA's Vulkan driver does not qualify); lavapipe (CI) is expected to, which the CI device report
will confirm. In addition, **FXC (D3D12 without DXC) fails to compile the reference's `normal_exponent`
(`bitcast<u32>(abs(x))`) with `E_FAIL`**, so the reference's `gemm_f16.wgsl`, `vit.wgsl` and FDPA self-test cases do not
build on D3D12 here; `ops.wgsl` does. On Dawn's Vulkan backend (`DLSS_NR_DAWN_BACKEND=vulkan`, NVIDIA) those compile
and match the oracles. `refKernels.gpu.test.ts` prints a device report of what is available.

Our TSL must compile under FXC too (the default local backend): test every kernel on D3D12.

**lavapipe (CI) has `shader-f16` but is not a trustworthy f16 reference.** Mesa llvmpipe (25.2, LLVM 20) folds the
round trip `f32(f16(x))` into `x`. The reference spells every half rounding that way: `round_accumulator`, the end
of each FP8 GEMM FDPA group (`vec4<f32>(vec4<f16>(sums * scale))`), and the SiLU table builder. On llvmpipe the half
accumulator therefore stays an unrounded f32 between groups, and a real f16 rounding happens only where a value is
stored as f16 or bitcast. In CI run 37030840217, 24% of the reference FP8 GEMM's raw half outputs were one half ulp
off. A CPU model of that folding reproduces every listed CI difference. The same inputs in Chrome on an RTX 3060 Ti
(D3D12 + DXC, real f16) equal `oracleGemmFp8` bit for bit on all seven cases (`test/browser/run-fp8-gemm-chrome.mjs`,
one-off and not part of any test run). So `RefKernels` reports `gemm_fp8` and `window_attend` unavailable on
llvmpipe (`SOFTWARE_F16_REASON`; override it with `DLSS_NR_TRUST_SOFTWARE_F16=1`). The local gate for reference
parity of the f16 kernels is real hardware in a browser:

```sh
node packages/three-dlss-nr/test/browser/run-fp8-gemm-chrome.mjs            # Chrome stable; --chrome <path>, --headed
```

Our TSL never relies on f16 hardware. It rounds with `nrRoundF16` on bit patterns, so it gives the same bytes on
lavapipe and on hardware.

## The graph and the network

`graph/Graph.ts` (`NRGraph`) is the port of `graph.js` `record` (lines 354-580). It builds 451 `NRKernel`s per valid
size. Their order, labels, kinds and workgroup counts equal a record-only run of the reference graph
(`graph/Graph.test.ts` checks this at 64x64, 300x500 and 512x512, through `test/reference/refModel.ts`
`recordGraphRequests`). Its tensor labels, shapes and formats equal the reference's too, so `readTensor(label)`
names the same tensor on both sides.

- Weights come from `NRModel`. The GEMM skip scales, which the reference reads at a byte offset into the stage
  buffer, come from `auxVector(tensor, offset, n)`. The post blend's two scales are one `auxPair`.
- Boundary captures (`captureBoundaries`) are `copy_words` kernels inside the one pass. There are 79 of them:
  `block-0` to `block-69` and the nine `transition-a-b` / `pooled-a-b`. A capture is not a dispatch.
  `NRGraphPass.index` is the index of the dispatch it follows, so `run({ until })` runs the first `until`
  dispatches and their captures, with the same index as the reference's recorder.
- `graph/attention.ts` is the graph's only link to the attention kernels. `windowQueriesFor(device)` picks 16
  queries per workgroup on devices that cannot run 512 invocations. The bytes are the same; the dispatch size is
  not.

`NRNetwork.ts` implements `NRBackend` (`id: 'tsl'`, factory `tslBackend`).

- A frame is one `renderer.compute(nodes)`.
- `create` compiles every node up front, one at a time, because three's progress callback needs `ProgressEvent`,
  which Node lacks.
  - Expect about 4-5 minutes on D3D12/FXC in Node at 64x64, most of it FXC.
- A model passed as an `NRModel` is borrowed and never disposed. Load it once and share it across resizes.
- `writeFeatures` writes the GPU buffer with `queue.writeBuffer` once it exists.

### Full-network parity (real Chrome)

`node packages/three-dlss-nr/test/browser/run-network-parity-chrome.mjs [--sizes 64x64,512x512] [--golden] [--stats]`
runs the reference `Network` (its own WGSL, fetched from the submodule) and `NRNetwork` on one device in one page
(`networkParityPage.ts`), with the synthetic model and `syntheticFeatures`. It compares all 79 boundaries, the three
post tensors and the head, byte for byte, and checks that a second run of each gives the same bytes. It also prints
the reference's per-boundary statistics, which are the synthetic-weights calibration gate.

- `--golden` writes our digests to `test/network/goldenDigests.ts`.
- `network.synthetic.gpu.test.ts` then checks the network against those digests in Node on any device, including CI
  lavapipe. The TSL port never uses f16 hardware.
- `--bisect N` runs both networks truncated after dispatch N and compares every tensor label both allocate.
- `--stats-only` runs the reference alone and checks the calibration gate. It is fast because nothing is compiled
  through TSL. Use it when changing `synthetic/gains.ts`, then re-pin the stage hashes (`generate.test.ts`) and
  rerun with `--golden`. The skip-scale ranges are per family (general, ViT, decoder window blocks): the residual
  stream's gain per block is steep in the mean scale.
- Results on the dev machine (RTX 3060 Ti, Chrome stable, D3D12 + DXC): at 64x64 and at 512x512, 83 of 83 tensors
  are bit-exact (79 boundaries, `post merge`, `post merge raw`, `post block raw`, head), repeat runs are identical,
  and 79 of 79 boundaries are in calibration range.
- In Node, `network.synthetic.gpu.test.ts` runs 64x64 by default. 512x512 needs `NR_FULL=1`: its single
  451-dispatch command buffer can trip the Windows driver timeout (TDR) on D3D12/FXC when the GPU is busy.
- `network.real.gpu.test.ts` runs the reference's own `loadFixture` / `runParity` on `NRNetwork`. It needs
  `NR_WEIGHTS` (a model directory) and `NR_FIXTURES` (a fixture directory, or a directory of them).

## Backends: the native TSL port and the reference shim

`src/backend/NRBackend.ts` defines `NRBackend` / `NRBackendFactory`. That is the network API of design chunk E, plus
`id`, `requirements`, GPU-resident `features` / `head` tensors, `memory`, and a timing result from `run`. The native
`NRNetwork` implements it unchanged (`class NRNetwork implements NRBackend`). Export a factory named `tslBackend` from
the index and the benchmark and parity page pick it up. `test/backendConformance.ts` (`backendProblems`,
`factoryProblems`) is the shared conformance check.

`src/reference-backend/` (entry point `three-dlss-nr/reference-backend`) is the **shim**: OpenDLSS-NR's reference
WebGPU port, its JS and WGSL byte for byte, driven on `renderer.backend.device`.

- **Bundling.** `scripts/bundle-reference.mjs` copies into `vendor/opendlss-nr/` (git-ignored, published via
  `files`) every module reachable from `src/network.js`, plus the WGSL as string constants in `shaders.js`. Each file
  gets a header naming the upstream file, the commit and the MIT license, and `LICENSE` and `SOURCE.json` (SHA-256 per
  file) go beside them. The script runs in `build`, `pnpm tsc` and `pnpm test:gpu`, and `--check` reports drift. It
  refuses a submodule that is not at the pinned commit. `bundle.test.ts` checks the vendored files against
  `git show <commit>:...`.
- **Orchestration.** `ReferenceWgslBackend.create` is the upstream `Network.create` without its `fetch` of the WGSL.
  The object it builds is an upstream `Network` instance, so `run`, `readHead` and `readBoundary` are the upstream
  methods. A model given as a URL loads through the upstream `Model.load`. An in-memory model (manifest plus stage
  bytes) is uploaded with the same steps.
- **Shared buffers.** `features` and `head` are `createTensor` storage attributes. `sharedTensorBuffer` has three
  create their GPU buffers up front (`renderer.backend.createStorageAttribute`) and hands them to the upstream graph
  under the keys the graph allocates them with. three's attribute code never creates a second buffer for an attribute
  that already has one. So a TSL frame node that binds `backend.features` or `backend.head` writes or reads the same
  buffer the WGSL graph uses. Writing `features` from the CPU goes through `queue.writeBuffer`, not `needsUpdate`. Do
  not set `needsUpdate` on these attributes: three would upload their stale CPU copy over the GPU data.
- **Frame adapter.** `ReferenceFrame` records the upstream demo's `input_features` / `compose` / history swap exactly
  as `production-pipeline.js` does, but takes each frame from three textures on the GPU:
  - A small pack pass writes the upstream `scene` buffer (RGBA16F halves) and `motion` buffer with `flip_y = 0`.
    `motion` is the uv offset to the previous position, y down, which is `(-v.x/2, v.y/2)` of three's NDC `velocity`.
  - A present pass unpacks the upstream's bgra8 canvas image into a three `StorageTexture` (`output`, rgba8unorm,
    display-ready sRGB bytes).
  - History works as upstream: it is invalid on the first frame, after `resetHistory()` or `reset: true`, and after a
    rebuild. The noise seed is the frame count.
  - Render targets: `RenderTarget(w, h, { count: 2, type: HalfFloatType, samples: 0 })`. Name the textures `output`
    and `velocity` for `mrt({ output, velocity })`, and call `setClearColor('velocity', black, 0)` so the background
    has no motion.
- **Timing** (`NRFrameTimer` in `src/backend/timing.ts`). Both backends bracket the frame on the queue with two empty
  compute passes that carry timestamp writes (`timestamp-query`). Both also take wall time from the first submit to
  `onSubmittedWorkDone`. The brackets do not depend on how a backend encodes its frame, so TSL and WGSL are measured
  the same way. The first `run` of a backend validates its frame inside an error scope and reports wall time only.

### Real-browser checks (not part of `pnpm test`)

Dawn in Node has no `shader-f16` on the Windows dev machine, so the shim runs in Chrome (D3D12 + DXC).
`test/browser/chrome.mjs` is a DevTools harness with no dependencies. It uses Chrome stable, else Playwright's
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\ms-playwright\chromium-*`. `test/browser/shimPage.ts` is the page.

- `node packages/three-dlss-nr/test/browser/run-shim-parity-chrome.mjs [--model <dir>] [--size 128x128]` compares the
  shim against the upstream port running standalone, with its own device, WGSL fetched from the submodule and the
  upstream `Network.create`.
  - Network: the same features in, then the head compared bitwise and every boundary compared.
  - Frames: three rendered frames with a moving camera. It compares the packed inputs, the features (noise lanes
    included), the head, the history and the presented image. The standalone side receives each frame through a CPU
    readback, as the upstream demo does.
- `node scripts/bench-backends.mjs [--model <dir>] [--sizes 512x512,1280x720]` reports, per backend and size, GPU and
  wall ms (min / median), create time, first-frame time and memory. Run it on an idle GPU.

`--model` defaults to `$NR_MODEL_DIR`. Without it, chunk A's generator writes a synthetic model once to
`node_modules/.cache/three-dlss-nr/synthetic-model`.

### Notes for the website (chunk G) and the fidelity suite (chunk H)

- **Switching at runtime.**
  - Keep one renderer, created on `createNRDevice()` so that `shader-f16` is enabled when the adapter has it.
  - List `[tslBackend, referenceWgslBackend]`. Disable a backend whose `unavailableReason(renderer)` is non-null and
    show that reason, which names the fix.
  - To switch, `dispose()` the current backend and `create` the other one at the same size.
  - Both backends read the same `features` layout and write the same `head`, so the frame code is shared. Your TSL
    input-features pass writes `backend.features` and your compose pass reads `backend.head`, with no copies.
  - To show the reference's own frame instead (its compose, display transform and history), use `ReferenceFrame` and
    draw `frame.output` with no tone mapping.
  - Reset history on every switch: the history buffers differ between the two paths.
- **Compile and warm-up.**
  - Creating the reference backend compiles about 200 specialised GEMM pipelines and about a dozen window-attention
    pipelines (`createComputePipelineAsync`, bounded concurrency), and records 451 dispatches.
  - Pipelines are cached per device and per override set, so a second `create` at the same size costs much less.
    Show the `onProgress` messages while it runs.
  - The first `run` validates the frame.
  - Load the weights once with `loadReferenceModel` and pass the result to every `create`. Otherwise each resize
    re-uploads about 141 MiB. Dispose the model separately.
  - The TSL backend loads its own weights, so switching keeps two copies on the GPU unless you dispose the one you
    are not using.
- **Memory** (reported by `backend.memory`). The reference holds:
  - the stage buffers (the whole model, about 141 MiB) plus its re-laid-out f16 matrices, priors and scales;
  - its activation tensors: many hundreds of MiB at 1280x720, more with `captureBoundaries`;
  - the SiLU and weight tables, kept per device;
  - with `ReferenceFrame`, about 20 bytes per pixel of frame buffers.

  Cap the demo's internal resolution as the design says: at most 1280x720 valid.

- **Fidelity suite** (`packages/fidelity-suite`, published at `/parity/`; see its README).
  - Three renderers per scene: `opendlss-nr` (standalone reference), `three-dlss-nr-tsl` and `three-dlss-nr-shim`,
    on the same CPU-built features from a three.js render.
  - To compare quality, run `tsl` and `reference-wgsl` through `NRBackend` on the same `writeFeatures` input, then
    compare `readHead` and `readBoundary(name)`. Boundary names are the reference's.
  - The shim needs `shader-f16`. In Node it only runs where Dawn exposes that feature, and lavapipe's f16 results are
    untrusted ("[B: lavapipe]" in the design). Render the committed results in Chrome on the dev GPU with the harness
    above.

## The integration pass (`integration/DlssNrPass.ts`, design chunk G)

- One frame: the scene into an RGBA16F MRT target (`textures[0]` colour named `output`, `textures[1]` named
  `velocity`, velocity cleared to 0), then `inputFeatures[p]` (`renderer.compute`), `backend.run()` (its own submit,
  awaited), then `compose[p]` plus a small unpack of the reference's bgra8 `image` into an rgba8unorm
  `StorageTexture`, then the present quad. `p = frameIndex & 1` selects the `NRHistory` ping-pong.
- Both backends use the same frame kernels: the features and head are three storage attributes bound to the
  backend's own buffers (`sharedTensorBuffer` for the shim), so nothing is copied. Compose writes the reference's
  `image` (display transform applied on the GPU, exactly as `frame.wgsl`), so the presented bytes are the
  reference's whenever D's kernels are byte-identical to `frame.wgsl` (D3D12: yes; NVIDIA Vulkan: rare one-step
  differences in the reprojected history). The quad samples that texture with bilinear filtering to the canvas size.
- NR off is drawn by the quad as `nrDisplayTransform(scene)` in a fragment shader: the same operator, but not
  bit-identical to the compute version (fma contraction), which is irrelevant for viewing.
- `DlssNrExternalFrame` is the escape hatch for a backend that records its own frame (`ReferenceFrame`); its
  `output` must be display-ready rgba8 bytes.
- The blend scale comes from `backend.blendScale` (shim) or `backend.model.blendScale()` (TSL port), else the
  `blendScale` option.
- `render()` waits for the network on the GPU (as the reference demo does), so the loop runs at the network's
  frame rate; a call while one is in flight returns null.
- Fidelity suite: `DlssNrPass` exposes `renderTarget` (the rendered colour / velocity) and `outputTexture` (the
  presented NR image); render into an RGBA8 target with `renderer.setRenderTarget(target)` before `render()` to read
  the presented frame back (the GPU test does this).

## Reference backend pipeline lifetime

`ReferenceWgslBackend` retains kernel programs per GPU device, with separate program sets for ViT token padding and
extra shader descriptors (name, source and ordered entry points). The pinned upstream compiler still specializes
GEMM/window pipelines by module, layout, entry point and all override constants. A resize can introduce new
specializations; returning to a previously prepared resolution reuses its pipelines. Concurrent creates share
program preparation. Rejected program preparation is removed so it can be retried, and device loss removes this
wrapper's program cache. The pinned upstream lookup-table builder has its own cache; a rejected SiLU-table
initialization remains an upstream limitation and requires a fresh device. This wrapper does not modify that code.

Only programs and upstream device lookup tables are shared. Each backend still creates its own tensors, graph,
recorder and frame resources. Disposing one graph leaves sibling graphs and the cached programs usable. Treat
`network.kernels`, `network.matmul` and `network.window` as shared internal objects: callbacks may record graph
passes but must not mutate these programs. Supply custom kernels through `extraShaders` instead.

Programs and pipeline specializations remain resident for the device lifetime; repeated distinct shader sets or
resolutions can increase retained driver memory. The cache uses weak device keys and clears on device loss, but
has no eviction limit for a live device. Activation memory remains per graph. Progress counts prepared specialized
dispatches, including repeated uses and cache hits; it does not measure newly compiled pipelines. Recording-device
unit tests verify graph/compiler reuse and ownership without executing shaders; GPU parity requires separate tests.
